>You have travelled to the main loading bay of tariskor, 
>where all metal harvesting takes place here.
>You see a flowing river of molten nickel and iron as you
>walk on the hot rocks. There is a small metal deposit next to you
>and a road leading to Mt. Rextion and one leading to the command center
>You walk up a hill to a plateu on Mt. Rexington, the temperature on your
>heat suit reads 231ËšC and continues to rise as you climb closer to the dormant volcano.
>Up here there is a gun case and a thermal vent into the 
>volcano with a path back to the loading bay
>You walk into the Command center, the central point of contact
>for all operations in the tariskor-1 region. There is a 
>terminal holding the door shut to both the storage room 
>and metal factory. There is another door to the outside
>loading bay. There is also a desk in the room and an 
>pile of spare parts in the corner of the room.
>You walk into the storage section of the Building, it's full of stuff
>there is an old bookcase, a pile of trash and a bin full of old power cells
>there is a door to the Command Center, the Metal factory and rextion port.
>The crew is now in the metal factory, it is incredibly hot due
>to the molten rock being trasfered across the floor.
>your compass begins to fail as the whole planet is made up of metal and rust.
>There is an operator and a hopper full of gold ingots.
>There are doors to the storage, the command center and rextion port
>You are now in rextion port, you look out the window to see
>a river of molten iron with large magnets suppressing the river
>In the port, there is a metal boat hull, a locked room to the drop zone
>and a wall covered in blueprints with a door to the metal factory and the storage
>Vulcan plains, a place of solid rock and sinking molten lava,
>By the river side, there is a port where your boat is stored and a pool of liqid gold
>There is a path to Vestic stockyard.
>You are now in Vestic stockyard, a small fenced of area leading to the Mt. Vestic (a magma mine).
>There is a pile of items in the corner and a
>security guard next to the entrance who seems to hold something important
>There are 3 paths: One to vulcan plains, one to mt. vulcan and a blast door to the mine
>You walk to the foot of Mt. Vulcan, the tallest volcano on the planet.
>Only a small section of the mine reaches into it due to 
>it constantly erupting and turning the minesshaft into a bouncy castle of rock.
>There is a gps on the floor, a tazer and a collapsed 
>mine with a road leading back to vestic stockyard
>You walk into the Mt. Vestic magma mine, you walk onto a steel catwalk
>as you walk over the main volcanic chute, you look down 
>and see the active volcano's magma stopped by large magnets.
>There is an office, some power cells on the floor and a catwalk back to vestic stockyard
>: Got some more info on this infection
>: What is it?
>: The SAC virus originated on planet Ventrin-426B
>: That used to be a isolated labratory planet owned by the Colorans
>: I know, that planet went radiosilent in 2261
