>: So, we know the location of the cure. It's in the vault.
>: What else is there? How can we enter the vault and what about the creator?
>: We'll have to find out. I don't know how we'll find the cure.
>: Uh, the radar tells us that there's a large enemy presence here
>: Shoot! We're being jumped!
>: Not quite yet, but yes.
>You look up into space, a large ship arrives on the space elevator platform.
>: Jeez! that was intense.
>: Yeah, good thing we survived that.
>: Anyway, the ambushers left someting behind.
>: It says here that the creator is hiding somewhere in Spiron city.
>: If we find him, we might find the cure and arrest him!
>: Hold on, there is a cure. One is in posession of the creator and the other is in the lab
>: So we have a choice?
>: Exactly, and I say we head straight to the lab to kill this thing for good
>: Hey! It's alive! We even know that it's sentient!
>: But it's purpose still is to kill
>: Reguardless of that, we need to head over now. Make the choice cap'n.
>: There are 2 locations:
>The Lab, Ventrin-426b
>Spiron city, Spira
>WARNING: Once you travel to Spiron city or the lab,
>you will stay there until the ending
